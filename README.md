BlueBus is a BlueTooth bus between an Arduino board and an Android mobile device.

* No need to know how to develop on Android! Just download the BlueBus app from the Market and launch it.
* Just include the BlueBus library in your Arduino program, and use it to set up the Android BlueBus app dashboard.
* Pair the Android BlueBus app with your Arduino device via BlueTooth.
* Use levers and other dashboard GUI controls to change your Arduino program behavior and to gauge its status.

### How To Include BlueBus In Your Arduino Project?

1. Copy the BlueBusArduino/BlueBus directory into your libraries folder (on Mac OSX it is usually `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries`, on Windows it is usually `C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\My Documents\Arduino\libraries`).
2. Restart the Ardiuno application. You should now be able to see BlueBus in the Sketch->Import Library menu, under Contributed Libraries at the end of the menu.
3. Create a new project, and import the BlueBus library. Alternatively, you can open the BlueBusSample project.
4. Compile and run.

*__Note:__ Still under development. Initial working version expected by October 2011.*

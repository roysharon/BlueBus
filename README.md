BlueBus is a BlueTooth bus between an Arduino board and an Android mobile device.

* No need to know how to develop on Android! Just download the BlueBus app from the Market and launch it.
* Just include the BlueBus library in your Arduino program, and use it to set up the Android BlueBus app dashboard.
* Pair the Android BlueBus app with your Arduino device via BlueTooth.
* Use levers and other dashboard GUI controls to change your Arduino program behavior and to gauge its status.

*__Note:__ Still under development. Initial working version expected by October 2011.*
